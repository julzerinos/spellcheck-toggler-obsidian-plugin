# Spellcheck Toggler

A plugin for Obsidian which gives you more control over the red-underline spellcheck behaviour.

If you spend most of your time in the editing view and find yourself annoyed by the red spellcheck underline, you might find this plugin handy to toggle spellchecks for select types of blocks in your notes.

Originally created to disable spellcheck underlining for links in the editing view, but can easily be expanded to support other types of blocks.

### Features

- Link toggles - toggle spellchecks for internal and external link texts.
- Modules - each toggle can be controlled from the plugin setting tab to customize for your use case.
- Open to requests - you can create an issue to request spellcheck toggling for a specific type of block.
